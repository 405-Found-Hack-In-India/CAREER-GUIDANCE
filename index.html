	   			<h2 class="">Why is it a difficult decision?</h2>

	   			<p class="lead">Along with being a very important decision, it is also a difficult decision to take, especially in today’s context. Today, students are faced with numerous options and several courses all of which look almost equally lucrative and interesting. This wide range of courses available today have further complicated the decision making process for the students. Gone are the days when a career as an engineer, doctor, chartered accountant and in other such core fields was the only good career opportunity. Students today have far more options available to them as compared to the ones a few years back. They are far more open to experimenting with new fields and are building careers as tea tasters, graphic designers, professional photographers, ethical hackers and many other such fields that were completely unheard of a few years back.

              	   	<h3>Choice – A Blessing or a Curse</h3>

							<p>The introduction of these new fields has been both a blessing and a curse for the Class 12 students. For someone wanting to build a career in an off-beat field this is a great time to follow their passion. But, in the lure of following their passion, students often end up picking a course or stream that they are not really ready for. Similarly, many students pick certain courses because they perceive them to be easier as compared to other mainstream choices.

Often we come across people who are unhappy with their work life and wish they could switch to some other field. But switching fields once you start working is not easy. Thus, students need to be very sure about the course they choose. It's important to ensure that whatever course you pick is in sync with your personal career interests.

              	   	<h3>What to do after 12th?</h3>

							<p>If you are a Class 12 student, along with preparing for the Board Exams, you will also have to deal with one interesting but really nagging question, i.e., ‘What to do after Class 12?’ While many Class 12 students might have already decided what they want to do after Class 12, there are many other students who are still confused and undecided about the future they want to build.

Irrespective of which category you fall under, the decision about what to do after Class 12, is a critical one. With a plethora of courses, streams, entrance exams and career paths to choose from, it is natural for students to get confused about what lies ahead? But although, the career decision post Class 12 is very important, it is not as intimidating as some of the students think. In this article, we will explore career options available to Class 12 students after their Board exams.

              	   	<h3>How to choose the right Graduation Course?</h3>

							<p>To take the first step toward choosing the right course after 12th you must first know what options are available to you and which ones are best suited to your interests. Some of the major points that students should factor in while deciding upon the best course for them are given below.

              	   	<h3>Your Interests</h3>

							<p>The first thing that you must consider while deciding the graduation course is your interest and passion about it. Having mental clarity about, what you want to do in future and how interested are in a particular field, will go a long way in helping you decide your graduation course. For instance, if you are interested in archeology but have interest in chemistry, then Art restoration or Museology might be a good career option for you.

					   <div class="feature-content">

              	   	<h3>Understanding of the course</h3>

							<p>Before you decide which course to pursue, it is also important to understand what a course entail and what all does it cover? Simply put, you must thoroughly understand what lies in the store for you once you join the course. This means understanding what subjects will be covered, what will you learn, what kind of teaching pedagogy is followed in a particular graduation course. There are many ways to gather important information about the graduation course you are planning to take up. The most convenient and obvious would be to talk to your seniors, siblings or parents. People who are working the fields that are similar to your interest will be able to guide you the best. Alternatively, you can also find relevant information on the internet or consult a career counselor.

              	   	<h3>Future Prospects</h3>

							<p>Another major factor to consider upon deciding a college course is its future prospects. Especially, if you are considering going for some new or off-beat courses, it is essential to understand the job and further study prospects that it holds. Going for a course that matches your interests is great but you should also be mindful of the future prospects that it offers.  One of the major questions that you should try to answer is, 'What are the career opportunities available after the course?' Also, look for, what prospects are available for higher studies in the field.

	   			<h2>Entrance Exams</h2>

	   			<p class="lead">One of the major concerns for students after 12th is to appear for entrance exams. Almost every stream be it arts, engineering, medical, commerce or any other, has its own set of entrance exams for admission to reputed colleges in the respective domains. Every year lakhs of students prepare diligently to crack the entrance exams related to the courses they are interested in taking at the graduation level. Depending upon the score the students get in these exams, they can apply to a plethora of courses offered by colleges across the country. Because of the increasing number of applicants and fierce competition for admissions, many reputed colleges have adopted entrance exams as a means to screen and shortlist the best candidates suited to their course and college. There are some common entrance exams also, which help students apply to multiple colleges with a single entrance exam. Some popular entrance exam in each study stream are below.  </p>
